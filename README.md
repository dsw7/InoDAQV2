## Setup

### Hardware requirements
While optional, it is strongly recommended to install [arduino-cli](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli).
This project's build system is based upon `arduino-cli`. To install `arduino-cli`, follow the
[Quickstart](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli#quickstart) section provided by the `arduino-cli`
developers. Alternatively, the `src/ino/ino.ino` "sketch" can be manually uploaded to the device via the
Arduino IDE.

If using `arduino-cli`, ensure that the Fully Qualified Board Name (FQBN) variable is updated in the
`Makefile`. This project was built atop an Uno which is reflected in the `Makefile`. If not working with an
Uno, change the FQBN as follows:
```
sed -i 's/FULLY_QUALIFIED_BOARD_NAME = arduino:avr:uno/FULLY_QUALIFIED_BOARD_NAME = <your-fqbn>/' Makefile
```
**NOTE:** This project was only tested with the Arduino Uno. Other boards may or may not be compatible.

### Python requirements
This project's GUI and API are written in Python and use several Python libraries. These libraries must be
installed. To install the libraries:
```
python3 -m pip install --user --requirement requirements.txt
```

### Uploading code to device
The code located in this repository must be uploaded to the device. To upload the code, run the `upload`
`make` target:
```
make upload SERIAL_PORT=<serial-port>
```
The `<serial-port>` argument can be either a COM port (if running from a Windows based host) or a device file
(if running from a Linux based host). In general, a serial port `COM<n>` maps to a device file `/dev/ttyS<n -
1>`. For example, `COM3` would map to `/dev/ttyS2`. This mapping may be relevant if running this program on
Cygwin.
